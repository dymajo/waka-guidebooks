# Getting to the Airport

## Route 2

The cheapest way to get to the airport is taking [Bus Route 2](https://waka.app/l/nz-wlg/NBM/2) to & from the corner of Hobart Street & Broadway (Stops [7033](https://waka.app/s/nz-wlg/7033) & [6033](https://waka.app/s/nz-wlg/6033)). You'll then need to walk 7 minutes through the Burger King & gas station to the airport - there are clearly marked walking paths.

From Wellington City, this is a three zone trip, costing \$3.74 for an Adult with Snapper. This trip takes around 30 minutes, including the walk from bus stop to the terminal.

## Rideshare

If you're heading to Wellington City, a ride-hailing app like Uber, Zoomy, or Ola is a good option. This is always faster than taking the bus. Wellington Airport charges a \$3 airport access fee, which you can avoid by walking 7 minutes to the Burger King & gas station outside the terminal. If the weather is poor, being picked up from the terminal is usually more appealing. A typical trip to/from Wellington City will **cost around \$20**, and takes around 15-20 minutes.

If you are being picked up from the airport, request the ride as soon as you see your bag (if you have one), or as you walk into the main terminal. You'll have to walk 3 minutes to the covered ride-hailing pickup zone. If you are being picked up from outside the airport, request your ride as soon as you leave the terminal building.

## Airport Flyer

The Airport Flyer is an express service that travels via Lower Hutt, Wellington, Haitaitai, and Kilbirnie to the airport. It follows a similar route to the Route 2 but makes less stops, continues to Lower Hutt, and takes you directly into the airport terminal. Frequency is around every 10 minutes at peak, and every 20 minutes at other times - please see the [NZ Bus Website for full timetables](https://www.nzbus.co.nz/data/content/files/airport-flyer-timetables.pdf). The journey is around 20 minutes from Wellington CBD - it not significantly faster than taking the Route 2. However, **it is a good option if you are traveling to/from Lower Hutt**.

The Airport Flyer does not show on any of the realtime displays, or in Waka. It also does not take Snapper, but EFTPOS, Credit Card, and Contactless Payments are available on-board. SuperGold cards are accepted. A route map is available on the [NZ Bus Website](https://www.nzbus.co.nz/data/content/files/airport-flyer-route-maps.pdf).
