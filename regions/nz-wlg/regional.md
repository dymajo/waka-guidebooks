### Northern Explorer

The Northern Explorer makes three return services each week from Wellington Station to Auckland Strand Station. It runs southbound from Auckland on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday departing at 7:45 am, and runs northbound from Wellington on Wednesdays, Friday, and Sunday departing at 7:55 am.

This service takes 11 hours and 40 minutes - significantly slower than driving (~9 hours) or flying (~1 hour). Despite the slow travel time, it is a very scenic journey - possibly one of the most beautiful train trips in the world. As it is primarily a tourist service, fares are upwards of \$100, depending on availability.

### Wairarapa Line

This service travels fully within the Wellington region, but has a total travel time of 1 hour and 40 mins from Wellington to Masterton. There are usually five return services each weekday, and two return services on the weekend. [Timetable information is available in Waka](https://waka.app/l/nz-wlg/RAIL/WRL).

While this service uses the same fare zone system as the rest of Wellington Region, **at afternoon peak times, you must travel a minimum of 8 zones**. While travel times are comparable to driving, the Wairarapa Line is notoriously unreliable - delays, cancellations, and bus replacements are frequent.

## Ferry Services

Services from Wellington to Picton are available through [Interislander](https://www.greatjourneysofnz.co.nz/interislander/) and [Bluebridge](https://www.bluebridge.co.nz/). Both these services are very comparable, taking around 3 hours and 30 minutes to complete the journey. This is weather dependent - sailings can be canceled or delayed in poor weather.

You are able to drive your vehicle onto the ship, or buy a normal ticket. There are no public transport services from Picton, but you may be able to get a coach service. The Interislander is generally more expensive, while the Bluebridge has smaller ferries - the Interislander generally can sail in poorer weather conditions. However your mileage may vary - it pays to shop around and book your tickets ahead of time.

## Flights

Wellington Airport is a medium sized airport located in Wellington City. To get there, please see the [Airport section of the guide](./airport). Flights are available through [Air New Zealand](https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/) or [Jetstar](https://www.jetstar.com/). Air New Zealand flies to more locations, while Jetstar is generally cheaper. However, this varies wildly so it pays to shop around.

Wellington Airport has around 20 return services to Auckland every day, and a similar number of services to Christchurch. It also services a number of other NZ centres including Hamilton, Tauranga, Rotorua, Napier, Blenheim, Nelson, and Queenstown.

Multiple daily direct flights are also available to Sydney & Melbourne. Direct flights are also available weekly to other destinations such as Brisbane, the Gold Coast, and Fiji.
