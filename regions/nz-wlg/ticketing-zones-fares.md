# Ticketing, Zones, and Fares

## Ticketing

### Buses & Cable Car: Snapper

The [Snapper Card](https://www.snapper.co.nz) offer a small discount over cash fares and can be used on the cable car and all buses on the Metlink Network. Services such as the 91 Airport Flyer & NCS routes are not part of the Metlink Network, and do not take Snapper.

To use a Snapper card, tag on when you board the bus, and tag off when alighting. You will be charged for the number of zones you travel though, but **transfers are free within 30 minutes**. If paying for more than one person, ask the bus driver, and you will both receive the discounted fare.

Snapper cards cost \$10 and can be purchased and topped up at [many convenience stores](https://www.snapper.co.nz/locations/#map). Snapper **does not support auto top-up** or online top-up, but can be reloaded via [NFC on Android Phones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.snapper.mobile).

### Trains

**Wellington Trains do not have electronic ticketing**. **Only Cash** is accepted on the train, but 10-Trip or monthly passes can be purchased at [some train stations and convenience stores](https://www.metlink.org.nz/tickets-and-fares/where-to-buy-your-train-tickets/). Special tickets for off-peak travel or concessions are also available - see the [fares](#bus-train-fares) section for more information.

To use a paper ticket, hand it to the ticket inspector on-board the train when they come around during your journey. While rail replacement buses have Snapper readers, they do not take Snapper - only train tickets or cash is accepted.

### Cable Car

In addition to Snapper, tickets for the Cable Car can also be purchased at the booth at the Lambton Quay station, or [online](https://www.wellingtoncablecar.co.nz/English/Tickets). Snapper is cheapest for occasional trips, but 10-Trip or 25-Trip tickets are available - see the fares section for further details.

### Ferries

Tickets for ferries can be purchased at the East by West ticket office at Queens Wharf or on-board - credit cards, EFTPOS and cash are accepted. Single, return, 10-trip, and monthly passes are available.

## Zones

Greater Wellington uses fare zones for trains and buses, which charges you for the overall distance you travel. You can make four transfers between buses and only pay a single fare, provided you **make transfers within 30 minutes**.

While train and bus fares are identical, you will need to pay a separate fare due to the different ticketing systems. To figure out your fare, count the number of zones you travel through when making your journey. However, if you leave a zone and enter it again, you will have to pay for the zone again. Additionally, some bus stops at the edges of zones are in multiple zones, which can reduce your fare if your journey starts or finishes there.

[A map of fare zones can be found here](https://www.metlink.org.nz/assets/Uploads/PT-Fare-zones.pdf). Information on the exact fare zone boundaries is available on the [Metlink Website](https://www.metlink.org.nz/tickets-and-fares/zones/).

## Bus & Train Fares

### Adult Fares

Off-peak travel carries a 25% discount, and requires you to either start your journey between **9am-3pm, or after 6:30pm on weekdays**, and also applies **all-day on weekends & public holidays**. There is no off-peak discount for cash fares.

The 10-Trip Train tickets are equivalent to the Snapper fare, but **10-Trip off-peak train tickets must be purchased separately**. As 10-Trip train tickets have the start and end zone printed on them, they are only useful for regular commutes.
