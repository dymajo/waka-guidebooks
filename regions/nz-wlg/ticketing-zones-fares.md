# Ticketing, Zones, and Fares

## Ticketing

### Buses & Cable Car: Snapper

The [Snapper Card](https://www.snapper.co.nz) offer a small discount over cash fares and can be used on the cable car and all buses on the Metlink Network. Services such as the 91 Airport Flyer & NCS routes are not part of the Metlink Network, and do not take Snapper.

To use a Snapper card, tag on when you board the bus, and tag off when alighting. You will be charged for the number of zones you travel though, but **transfers are free within 30 minutes**.

Snapper cards cost \$10 and can be purchased and topped up at [many convenience stores](https://www.snapper.co.nz/locations/#map). Snapper **does not support auto top-up** or online top-up, but can be reloaded via [NFC on Android Phones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.snapper.mobile).

### Trains

**Wellington Trains do not have electronic ticketing**. **Only Cash** is accepted on the train, but 10-Trip or monthly passes can be purchased at [some train stations and convenience stores](https://www.metlink.org.nz/tickets-and-fares/where-to-buy-your-train-tickets/).

To use a paper ticket, hand it to the ticket inspector on-board the train when they come around during your journey. If you are doing a significant amount of travel off-peak, you can also **purchase a 10-Trip off-peak ticket**. While rail replacement buses have Snapper readers, they do not take Snapper - only train tickets or cash is accepted.

### Ferries

Tickets for ferries can be purchased at the East by West ticket office at Queens Wharf or on-board - credit cards, EFTPOS and cash are accepted. Single, return, 10-trip, and monthly passes are available.
